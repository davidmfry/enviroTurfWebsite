        <TeamMember name='Jim Bateman' phoneNumber='601.672.6020' bio='Chief Executive Officer of EnviroTurf began his
career in the turf business in the year 2000 in an
effort to help Belhaven College install synthetic
turf on Newell Field. What was to be a short-term
avocation became a passion, and in 2004 he formed
SurfacesPlus, LLC and began actively building a
company known throughout the South as a leader in
the installation of sports surfaces of all types.
After a 30-year career in the financial services
industry, this seemed like an unusual change, but
Jim has used his experience as a financial advisor
to add a unique fund-raising dimension to his
company by helping schools and municipalities
pursue grants, private-sector donations, and other
joint-venture opportunities to assist their
projects. These projects have ranged from multimillion-dollar
complexes to weight-room floors, but
all are guided by an unwavering commitment to
excellence.'/>
